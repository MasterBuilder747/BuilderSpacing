# BuilderSpacing
Clash of clans: proper builder spacing calculator

Do you ever have a time when you have too much spacing between two builders and want to build in between that time, but can't figure out how to time it right? Then this tool is for you! 

Just put in (in days and hours only, minutes are not supported):

1. the shorter builder time
2. the longer builder time
3. the desired build time (which is less than the larger build time)

The app will tell you the time you need to wait until you can build the desired build right in between the two builder times!
